need x_pos variable to incorporate movement/idea of coordinates
need y_pos variable to incorporate movement/idea of coordinates
need fire vairable to incorporate coordinates when a bullet is fired

creating display screen

creating "Michigan Football Asteroid" caption on display screen

must update display when new element is incorporated in the screen

filling the screen with a white background
updating display to show this new background


setting exitgame=false so it only exits when the gameExit variable=True
#why do you set the variable = false instead of true but use while not in the next loop
updating display within the while loop so it will contuilly change the background when sprites move
Next few are just quiting the program if the event.type = QUIT(clicking the red x)



When you comment out this line only 1 rectangle appears but you cant fire

if the event is a keydown 
if that key down is a left, move the sprites x position by 10 to the left


71- actually moving the bullet within the screen
